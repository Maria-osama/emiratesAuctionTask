- To run this App you need to run the following commands:
    * npm install
    * npm start

---------------------------------------------------------------

- logic steps:

step 1- At the first time we load the application, the whole data is loaded from API and stored in local storage with Expiration time [ex: 20 second]

step 2- each time we refresh the application or reload it , I check if:
           * data is still found in localStorage , if yes : then check if it's not Expired (compare between Expiration time and the current time ).
                                                   if not Expired, then use it.
                                                   if Expired : then remove the key from localStorage and call the API again and repeate step 1.


step 3- For the localization, I used Redux to store the current language of the application, to be shared between the whole pages,
        and stored it in local storage as well to keep the choosen language in each time we load the application

step 4- I used Axios for calling API.
step 5- I used Routing for navigation between the pages.
